        * Adding normal mode of E-STM in linkedlist, 
	deque, skiplist, hashtable benchs
        
[0.4.0 release]

2011-06-18 Vincent Gramoli <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
        * Adding the choice between elastic and normal transactions
        for the add operation in the red-black tree algorithm

[0.3.8 release] 

2011-03-04 Vincent Gramoli <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
        * Fix freeing the memory in the lock-coupling 
	linked list upon removal in alternate mode

[0.3.7 release] 

2010-11-28 Vincent Gramoli <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
        * Fix the deallocation of memory in skiplist benchmark

[0.3.6 release] 

2010-02-23 Vincent Gramoli <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
        * double-ended queue sequential and STM-based benchs.
        * rbtree wrappers for sequential and STM-based benchs.

2010-01-03 Vincent Gramoli <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
        * update ratio made effective: a failed remove/add is a read-only
	  tx no longer an update tx.

[0.3.5 release] 

2009-11-18  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>	
	* Fixed deque index in rightpush functions.
	* Removed "break" points in the sequential code.

[0.3.4 release] 

2009-11-04  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
	* Allowing spinlocks instead of mutexes in the lock-coupling 
          linked list.
	* Fixing lock coupling search of the linked list that wrongly 
          acquired a single lock before releasing another: memory is 
          cleanly freed.
	* Extra function calls in the sequential case have been inlined.

[0.3.3 release] 

2009-09-25  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
	* Always remove a randomly generated value.
	  This produced update workloads executing faster than 
	  read-only workloads.

[0.3.2 release] 

2009-09-25  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
	* Herlihy's double-ended queue implementation.

[0.3.1 release] 

2009-09-25  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
	* STM red-black tree benchmark added: it reuses the code of TL2 
	  red-black tree but consecutive insert and delete do not get
	  the same value (by default). Inserting/deleting the same 
	  value consecutively is known as minimizing the tree 
	  rebalancing (main source of contention). 
	* red-black tree "-a" option allows consecutive insert and 
	  deletes to have the same value as a parameter.

[0.3.0 release]

2009-09-01  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
        * Fixing memory leaks

2009-08-20  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
        * Fixing some uninitialization bug of hashtable

2009-02-02  Vincent Gramoli  <vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au>
	* Added skip list test.
	* Added hash table test w/ move and sum operations.

[0.1.0 release]

       * First release with lock-based, lock-free, stm-based hashtable,
         linked list.
